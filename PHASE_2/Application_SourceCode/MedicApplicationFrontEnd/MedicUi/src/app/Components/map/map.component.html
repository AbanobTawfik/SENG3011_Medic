    Outbreak of Listeria Infections Linked to Enoki Mushrooms\n\n\tPosted March
    10, 2020 at 4:30 PM ETCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several
    states, and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a
    multistate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections linked to enoki
    mushrooms. Recall and Advice for Consumers, Food Service Operators, and
    RetailersAt A GlanceReported Cases: 36States: 17Hospitalizations: 30Deaths:
    4Recall: YesRecall InformationOn March 9, 2020, Sun Hong Foods, Inc.
    recalled enoki mushrooms because they may be contaminated with Listeria
    monocytogenes bacteria. Enoki mushrooms are white, with long stems and small
    caps. Enoki mushrooms from Sun Hong Foods were sold in 7. 05 oz / 200 g
    clear plastic packaging with a green label. “Product of Korea” is labeled on
    the front of the packaging, and “Sun Hong Foods, Inc. ” is labeled on the
    back of the packaging underneath the bar code. These products can also be
    identified by the UPC code: 7 426852 625810. This investigation is ongoing
    to determine the source of contamination and if additional products are
    linked to illness. Advice to Consumers, Food Service Operators, and
    RetailersDo not eat, serve, or sell any recalled enoki mushrooms distributed
    by Sun Hong Foods, Inc. Check your refrigerator for recalled enoki
    mushrooms. Return them to the purchase location or throw them away. Do not
    eat any food made with recalled enoki mushrooms, even if some was consumed
    and no one became sick. Wash and sanitize any surfaces and containers that
    may have come in contact with the recalled enoki mushrooms. Listeria can
    survive in refrigerated temperatures and can easily spread to other foods
    and surfaces. Follow these five steps to clean your refrigerator. Wash
    surfaces with hot, soapy water. Wash containers with hot, soapy water or
    clean in the dishwasher. Call your healthcare provider if you have consumed
    recalled enoki mushrooms and are experiencing symptoms of Listeria
    infection. Until we learn more about the source and distribution of the
    enoki mushrooms, CDC advises that people at higher risk for Listeria
    infections – pregnant women, adults ages 65 or older, and people with
    weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer or on dialysis – avoid
    eating any enoki mushrooms labeled as “Product of Korea”. At home, check
    your refrigerator for enoki mushrooms labeled as “Product of Korea”. If you
    have them, don’t eat them and throw them out. If you have them, wash and
    sanitize drawers or shelves in refrigerators where they were stored. Follow
    these five steps to clean your refrigerator. When you buy, order, or eat
    out, check with stores and restaurants that they do not use enoki mushrooms
    labeled as “Product of Korea”. If they don’t know where their enoki
    mushrooms are from, don’t buy or order the product. Call your healthcare
    provider if you have consumed enoki mushrooms labeled as “Product of Korea”
    and are experiencing symptoms of Listeria infection. Latest Outbreak
    Information36 people infected with the outbreak strain of Listeria
    monocytogenes have been reported from 17 states. Illnesses started on dates
    ranging from November 23, 2016 to December 13, 2019. 30 hospitalizations
    have been reported. Four deaths have been reported from California, Hawaii,
    and New Jersey. Six pregnancy-associated cases have been reported, of which
    two resulted in fetal loss. Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates
    that enoki mushrooms labeled as “Product of Korea” are the likely source of
    this outbreak. On March 9, 2020, Sun Hong Foods, Inc. recalled enoki
    mushrooms labeled as “Product of Korea” because they may be contaminated
    with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. This investigation is ongoing to
    determine the source of contamination and if additional products are linked
    to illness. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.
    Symptoms of Listeria InfectionListeriosis can cause different symptoms,
    depending on the person and the part of the body affected. Pregnant women
    typically experience only fever and other flu-like symptoms, such as fatigue
    and muscle aches. However, infections during pregnancy can lead to
    miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection
    of the newborn. People other than pregnant women: Symptoms can include
    headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions in
    addition to fever and muscle aches. Symptoms for invasive listeriosis
    usually start 1 to 4 weeks after eating food contaminated with Listeria.
    Some people have reported symptoms starting as late as 70 days after
    exposure or as early as the same day of exposure. Listeriosis is treated
    with antibiotics. Investigation DetailsMarch 10, 2020CDC, public health and
    regulatory officials in several states, and the U. S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of Listeria
    monocytogenes infections linked to enoki mushrooms. Public health
    investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may
    be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of
    public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC.
    DNA fingerprinting is performed on Listeria bacteria isolated from ill
    people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called
    whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of
    these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives
    investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In
    this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were
    closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are
    more likely to share a common source of infection. As of March 9, 2020, 36
    people infected with the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes have been
    reported from 17 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in
    each can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page. Listeria samples from
    ill people were collected from November 23, 2016 to December 13, 2019. Ill
    people range in age from less than 1 to 97 years, with a median age of 67.
    Fifty-eight percent of ill people are female. Of 32 ill people with
    information available, 30 hospitalizations have been reported. Four deaths
    have been reported from California, Hawaii, and New Jersey. Six cases are
    pregnancy-associated and two resulted in fetal loss. Investigation of the
    OutbreakEpidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that enoki mushrooms
    labeled as “Product of Korea” are the likely source of this outbreak. State
    and local public health officials interviewed ill people about the foods
    they ate in the month before they became ill. Twelve out of 22 (55%)
    reported eating mushrooms, including enoki, portobello, white, button,
    cremini, wood ear, maitake, and oyster. Michigan Department of Agriculture
    and Rural Development collected mushrooms for testing from a grocery store
    where an ill person purchased enoki mushrooms. Two samples of enoki
    mushrooms yielded the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes. These
    mushrooms are labeled as “Product of Korea” and were distributed by Sun Hong
    Foods, Inc. Additional product testing is ongoing in California. On March 9,
    2020, Sun Hong Foods, Inc. recalled enoki mushrooms (UPC 7 426852 625810)
    labeled as “Product of Korea”. Consumers, food service operators, and
    retailers should not eat, serve, or sell recalled enoki mushrooms. Enoki
    mushrooms distributed by Sun Hong Foods, Inc. do not account for all
    illnesses in this outbreak. FDA is working to identify the source of the
    enoki mushrooms distributed by Sun Hong Foods, Inc. and determine if other
    distributors received the same enoki mushrooms. CDC is concerned that enoki
    mushrooms labeled as “Product of Korea” may be contaminated with Listeria
    monocytogenes and are advising people at higher risk – pregnant women,
    adults ages 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems – to
    avoid eating any enoki mushrooms labeled as “Product of Korea”, until
    investigators determine the source of contamination and if additional
    products are linked to illness. CDC will provide updates when more
    information is available.
